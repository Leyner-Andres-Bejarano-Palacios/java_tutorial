# When should you use static method

The primary purpose of static methods is to implement functions; the primary purpose of non-static (instance) methods is to implement data-type operations. Either type of method may appear in client code, but you can easily distinguish between them, because a static method call starts with a class name (uppercase, by convention) and a non-static method call always starts with an object name (lowercase, by convention).
