# 10_encapsulation_why_private_is_so_important

No. Java also allows public and protected to allow some clients to refer directly
to instance variables. As described in the text, the advantages of allowing client code to
directly refer to data are greatly outweighed by the disadvantages of dependence on a
particular representation, so all instance variables are private in our code. We also oc-
casionally use private instance methods to share code among public methods.
