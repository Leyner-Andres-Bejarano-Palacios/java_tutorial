# Wrapper type

Java supplies built-in reference types known as wrapper types, one for
each of the primitive types: Boolean , Byte , Character , Double , Float , Integer , Long ,
and Short correspond to boolean , byte , char , double , float , int , long , and short ,
respectively. These classes consist primarily of static methods such as parseInt() but
they also include the inherited instance methods toString() , compareTo() , equals() ,
and hashCode() . Java automatically converts from primitive types to wrapper types
when warranted, as described on page 122. For example, when an int value is concat-
enated with a String , it is converted to an Integer that can invoke toString() .
