Generics. An essential characteristic of collection ADTs is that we should be able to use
them for any type of data. A specific Java mechanism known as generics, also known
as parameterized types, enables this capability. The impact of generics on the program-
ming language is sufficiently deep that they are not found in many languages (including
early versions of Java), but our use of them in the present context involves just a small
bit of extra Java syntax and is easy to understand. The notation < Item > after the class
name in each of our APIs defines the name Item as a type parameter, a symbolic place-
holder for some concrete type to be used by the client. You can read Stack< Item>  as
“stack of items.” When implementing Stack , we do not know the concrete type of Item ,
but a client can use our stack for any type of data, including one defined long after we
develop our implementation.
