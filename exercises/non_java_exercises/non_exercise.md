# 1.1.1 Give the value of each of the following expressions:

### exercise 1.1.1 a

( 0 + 15 ) / 2

### solution 1.1.1 a

the parenthesis is telling us that we should do the sum first so this is another way of expression this is 15 / 2, so the only questino we have is if the result of this will be stored in a int or a decimal (float or double)

### exercise 1.1.1 b

2.0e-6 * 100000000.1

### solution 1.1.1 b

firs we need to say that 2.0e-6 is 2 power (-6) the resulting number is 0.{5 zeros here}2  multiplicating 100000000.1, so the real question is 100000000.1 * 0.0000020

### exercise 1.1.1 c

true && false || true && true

### solution 1.1.1 c

Some parenthesis here would be really helpful, but its ok, so, as mentioned earlier "The operators && and || are valid only in boolean expressions are included separately because of short-circuiting: an expression is evaluated left-to-right and the evaluation stops when the value is known."..... so the first evaluation  

true && false

result in false, the resulting expresion is  false || true && true

The next evaluation

false || true

Would be true, the resulting expression would be true && true

The result of everything would be true

# 1.1.2 Give the type and value of each of the following expressions:

### exercise 1.1.2 a

(1 + 2.236)/2

### solution 1.1.2 a

the result is a decimal, specically a float due to the few decimals of the results-----> 1,618

### exercise 1.1.2 b

1 + 2 + 3 + 4.0

### solution 1.1.2 b

java do type conversion for this operations, at the end we have 10.0, a float

### exercise 1.1.2 c

4.1 >= 4

### solution 1.1.2 c

boolean, true

### exercise 1.1.2 d

1 + 2 + "3"
### solution 1.1.2 d

"33"
