Something important I would like to point out with this exercise is the use of javac and dockerfile. Usually when java is taught in universities, IDE are used but when you really want to learn something you should not use tools that make it easy for you, at least not while you are learning. The other important aspect of this and next exercises is the pressence of docker. Docker has several great feature like the portability and the better use of resources like memory or cpu.In this occasion the feature that matter the most to us is the fact that you can use any programming language or multi server design that you want making it easier to get started (apart that if you are like me, the least things that you need to install the better).

#### 1-1_w3resource_basic_5

To execute this command, use docker run -i -t IMAGENAME.

#### 1-1_w3resource_basic_15

This is a really interesting one, first of all , how could you know the way to execute a bash command from java ? stack overflow is my passion. The next question is, how could you know which packect to import to use StringBuffer, the answer, just google it, the first link will show the package required in this case java.lang.StringBuffer.
